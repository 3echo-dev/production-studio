// The pre-spend gate for storyboard panels. Proves the PLAN is safe to generate, before a
// single credit moves. Its sibling preflight-media.js proves the PIPE (that a generated file
// can reach disk). Run both before the first create_image_job of a project.
//
//   node preflight-generation.js <client> <job-id> [--json]
//
// Checks, in order:
//   1. the latest storyboard/v{n}/panels.md exists and lists panels with stable ids
//   2. the generation manifest names only panels on that board, and every panel once
//   3. one panel is marked as the sample, and the batch is not asked for before the sample
//      approval exists (approvals/sample-{n}.json, decision approved)
//   4. the panels still to generate fit the ceiling. Before the sample approval the ceiling is
//      credit_ceiling_per_job in CONFIG.md. After it, the ceiling is what the person agreed for
//      the batch (maxSpendCredits) on top of the panels that were on disk when they agreed
//      (scope.panelsOnDisk, written by record-approval.js). A panel counts as generated the
//      moment its file is on disk; no status word in the manifest changes the count. This used
//      to count every manifest item against the batch figure, so a ceiling recorded as the 43
//      panels remaining was refused as over the 43 agreed, and the guard taught people to work
//      around it.
