  Resumes an existing pre-production project. Reads status.md, reconciles it against what is on disk and
  what the board has landed, reloads the context the next stage needs, and continues from the
  correct place. Never passes a gate. Use for "resume", "continue", "where were we", "pick up
  {job-id}", or after a decision on the board.

# Resume a project

**Purpose:** continue a project from disk and the board, not from memory of a conversation. Used by the user, `1-22`, and `review`.

## Steps

1. **Find the project.** If either argument is missing, `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/list-jobs.js" {client}`. One project: take it. Several: ask, most recent first.

   The id is the board's project id, so open its page now, before reading anything: `pane.js "{job-id}" "{title}"` (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/SHARED-RULES.md`); never print the web address, then watch it ("Watching the board" in SHARED-RULES) and say in one line whether the board can wake this run. The title is the client and the film in the words `status.md` uses today.

2. **Read the board first, every time.** Follow the `pre-board-sync` skill: read the gate documents, the open inbox rows and the registers into a JSON file, then:

   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/board-sync.js" land {client} {job-id} "{file.json}"
   ```

   It prints what changed since the last landing: a gate signed off, a question answered, a change requested, rows entered. A turn that opened with `[Artifact comment sent to Claude]` is the board ringing for exactly this landing; reply in that thread in one line once you have acted.

3. **Read `status.md`**, its Notes block first: live constraints, an open revision, a deferred question, the credit tally for panels.

4. **Reconcile against disk.** If `status.md` disagrees with the files, the files win. Correct it with `set-state.js`, say what you corrected in one clause. Read the state off the last artifact present, against `plan.md`, with the table in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/SHARED-RULES.md`.

   Never redo work that exists. Re-spawn only the director whose file is missing or sent back.

5. **At a gate**, run `board-sync.js pull --gate {g}`. Exit 0 means the human signed it off and the approval is on disk: carry on. Exit 1 names a file that changed after the sign-off: re-present that item. No decision yet: report what is waiting and stop.

6. **Reload the context the next stage needs**, from disk, in full, never from a summary: the owning director's Contract `reads:` block.

7. **Verify.** If the last batch was never checked, run `collect-artifacts.js` now.

8. **Mirror.** When a connected folder is in use, `sync-manifest.js {client} {job-id}` lists what changed since the last copy; copy that and nothing else.

## The states you cannot resume past

Every state whose row in `scripts/lib-states.js` names a gate.

**Resuming is not approval.** "Continue" while a gate is open asks you to run the step only they can run. Ask for the decision, in the words `lib-wording.js` gives, and point at the board.

## Rules

The shared rules in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/SHARED-RULES.md` apply.

1. Land the board before deciding anything; a decision made while you were away is probably already there.
2. A change request lands as an inbox row, not as a new version: re-enter the owning row with `revisions/{n}.json`.
3. Register rows land from the board only; never type one to unblock a resume.

## Output contract

Writes nothing of its own. Corrects `status.md` where it disagreed with disk; lands the board.

## Report back

Two lines: what is waiting, and what to do about it. Then end the turn.

> **HTF, Night Shift** - Gate A is waiting on you. Budget sheet and timeline still have 11 unknowns.
>
> Sign off the creative on the board, or say what to change.

## Failure modes

| Failure | Fix |
|---|---|
| Inferring the stage from the conversation | Read `status.md`, then the disk, then the board |
| Re-running a director to fill one gap | Re-spawn only what is missing |
| Saying the project is at an internal state | Say what `list-jobs.js` printed |
| Resuming without landing the board | Land first; the decision may be there |
