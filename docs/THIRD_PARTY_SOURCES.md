# Third-party sources

Nothing here is installed or linked at runtime. Each row says which of our files a rule or a
script came from, so anything that looks wrong can be traced back to what was actually read.

- `kernel` means the file was carried over from social-media-pipeline and re-skinned for pre-production.
- `adapted` means rules, structures or numbers rewritten for our stages and gates.
- `vendored` means close to a copy. Exactly one file is vendored: `scripts/watch-video.py`, from `claude-video`, which keeps its MIT notice at the top.
- `wrapped` means read in place at runtime and never copied: every one of the client's skills.

## The kernel

| Our files | Source | Repo | License | Usage | What was taken |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `scripts/*.js` (workspace resolver, router shape, planner, scaffolds, state machine as data, set-state, stage, hash-artifact, record-approval, check-approval, collect-artifacts, check-deps, note-failure, sync-manifest, pane, pane-file, validate-schema, preflight-*, check-3echo, save-asset-bytes, contact-sheet), `hooks/**`, `scripts/hooks/**`, `scripts/test/**` (structure), `docs/` structure, `templates/status.md`, `templates/plan.md`, `templates/approval.json`, `CONFIG.md` shape, `.claude-plugin/**` | the whole repository at v0.12.9 | https://github.com/3echo-dev/social-media-pipeline | MIT | kernel | Files as state, deterministic routing, the executable workflow table, the state table as data, hash-bound approvals, the single-spender rule, command and function hooks, the test discipline, the word budgets, the house style for agents and skills. The social skin (nine role agents, twenty-three skills, platform rules, four workflows, hand-off and metrics) was removed; `lib-gate.js` became `lib-board.js`. |
| `skills/storyboard/SKILL.md`, `scripts/scaffold-client.js` (shape), `CONFIG.md` max_agent_depth | Creative Discovery plugin v1.22.0 (3echo, internal; `skills/storyboard/SKILL.md`, the client scaffold, the coordinator's depth rule) | 3echo Creative Discovery | ours | derived, via social-media-pipeline | local, 2026-09-14 | Third-generation storyboard cut (4,755 words there, 647 in the pipeline, about 600 here); the client workspace shape; leaf agents never spawn. |

## Wrapped at runtime, never copied

the client's skills, read in place under `workspaces/{client}/client/skills/` by `skills/client-skill-wrap`: `the-creative-director`, `no-ai-slop`, `inspiration-references`, `video-watch`, `reference-match-director`, `defuddle`, `generative-frame-craft`, `clip-director`, `htf-night-shift-frames`, `openmontage-craft`, `vo-roundtrip`, `kisah-prompt-department`. They are the client's; nothing from them is in this repository.

The chain-execution pattern (manifest, stage directors, checkpoints, human gates) was read from https://github.com/calesthio/OpenMontage (AGPL-3.0) as inspiration only and re-derived in our own words. No prose or code copied.

## Patterns learned for the playbooks

OpenMontage is AGPL-3.0. Nothing from it is copied; each row names a structure that was learned and rewritten in our words for `playbooks/`. Repo: https://github.com/calesthio/OpenMontage.

| Our file | Source file | Repo | License | Usage | What was taken |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `playbooks/script-method.md` | `skills/pipelines/cinematic/script-director.md` | calesthio/OpenMontage | AGPL-3.0 | pattern only, no prose copied | beat map before scenes (hook, escalation, reveal, landing, midpoint turn), dialogue sparingly, title cards short, beat truth kept in metadata, quality gate shape |
| `playbooks/script-method.md` | `skills/creative/storytelling.md` | calesthio/OpenMontage | AGPL-3.0 | pattern only, no prose copied | but-therefore joins between beats, scaling by duration as a table, one camera-intent line per beat, narration speed as a timing check |
| `playbooks/storyboard-method.md` | `skills/pipelines/cinematic/scene-director.md` | calesthio/OpenMontage | AGPL-3.0 | pattern only, no prose copied | hero frames named first, limited transition vocabulary, five aspects per frame with N/A written, overlays listed separately from the frame |
| `playbooks/storyboard-method.md` | `skills/creative/image-gen-usage.md` | calesthio/OpenMontage | AGPL-3.0 | pattern only, no prose copied | a shared style preamble repeated in every prompt, a hero reference before a batch, consistency across a sequence |
| `playbooks/audio-rules.md` | `skills/creative/sound-design.md` | calesthio/OpenMontage | AGPL-3.0 | pattern only, no prose copied; mix levels deliberately dropped | music by content type as tempo bands, instrumental under speech, SFX categories with durations, whoosh timing before the cut |
| `playbooks/references-method.md` | `skills/meta/video-reference-analyst.md` | calesthio/OpenMontage | AGPL-3.0 | pattern only, no prose copied | five-aspect description of a reference clip, a capability audit turned into a "what it would need" line, critical questions before proposing |
| `playbooks/review-rubrics.md` (leaf R) | `skills/meta/reviewer.md` | calesthio/OpenMontage | AGPL-3.0 | pattern only, no prose copied | accurate, complete, constructive findings; two revision rounds maximum; review the artifact not the process |

The client's own documents in the handoff (shoot board, concept breakdown, call sheet, project timeline) are the standard the breakdown, call sheet, shot list, storyboard and planning playbooks describe. Their structure is described; their content is never reproduced in this plugin.
