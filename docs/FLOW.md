# Flow

Every path a project can take, and every point it can stop.

[`../README.md`](../README.md) is what the plugin does. [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) is
how the pieces fit. This is the sequence.

After every row: `record-version.js`, `record-run.js`, `set-state.js`, `board-sync.js push`.
Before every decision: read the board, `board-sync.js land`.

## The one workflow

`workflows/1-22.md`. Every row runs on every project; the two tags only add milestones.

## The three gates

| Gate | After | Passes when | Who | Not applicable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A, creative sign-off | Stage 1 | script version selected; storyboard approved in its one style after the sample; shot list approved; budget and timeline templates accepted; references selected | the creative director; the assistant accepts the templates | never |
| B, logistics sign-off | Stage 2 | talents, props and locations entered or explicitly not applicable; audio approved | assistant enters, the creative director confirms | allowed on the three registers |
| C, release to shoot | Stage 3 | breakdown checked against a sample; every shoot day's sheet approved | production lead, per day | never |

A gate is signed off on the board. `board-sync.js pull` binds the record to the file hashes; a file
that changed after the sign-off makes the sign-off fail, and the item is re-presented.

Before each gate row (1h, 2f, 3c) a review pass runs: the check scripts first, then a reviewer
spawned with no memory of the work, reading against the gate's section of
`playbooks/review-rubrics.md`. A critical finding re-enters the owning row through
`revisions/{n}.json`; after two rounds the gate opens with the warnings attached, and the person
decides with them in view.

---

## XX items

Six items wait on a person. The director prepares a skeleton or a pre-filled template; the item
shows the tape stamp on the board; the person fills it there; the rows land on disk through
`board-sync.js land`. The orchestrator carries on with rows that do not need the answer: audio
does not wait for talents. `unknown` is a question and blocks Gate B; `not applicable` is a
decision with a name on it and does not.

---

## Change propagation

```
a person presses Change on an approved item
        |
        +- the item and every dependent item go to needs review on the board
        +- only that item's gate reopens
        +- an inbox row of type change lands
        |
orchestrator lands it, writes revisions/{n}.json, re-enters the owning row
        |
        +- 1st time  -> the director revises only what the note requires
        +- 2nd time  -> again
        +- 3rd time, same code, same row  -> ESCALATED: all three findings shown, stop
```

| Changed | Sent back for review |
|---|---|
| brief | everything |
| script | storyboard, shot list, budget, timeline, audio, props, locations, breakdown, call sheets |
| storyboard | shot list, audio, props, locations, breakdown, call sheets |
| shot list | budget, timeline, registers, breakdown, call sheets |
| any register or audio | breakdown, call sheets |
| timeline | call sheets |

Previous versions are never deleted. Nothing downstream regenerates until the changed item is
approved again.

---

## Where it can stop before spending

| Check | Catches |
|---|---|
| `route-job.js` rule 3 | No Brief file in the pull |
| The quote question | No yes on record |
| `check-3echo.js` | 3echo unreachable, or the balance will not cover the board |
| `preflight-generation.js` | Manifest disagrees with the panel table, or over the ceiling |
| `preflight-media.js` | Generated files cannot reach disk |
| The sample panel | One credit, approved on the board before the batch |

---

## Resuming

```
/resume-project htf
        |
        +- open the board pane
        +- read status.md
        +- read the board, board-sync.js land
        +- reconcile: the files win over the header
        +- at a gate: pull; no record yet means stop and say what is waiting
        +- continue from the first row whose file is missing
```

It will not walk through a gate you did not sign off. A project left at Gate B a week ago is still
waiting there, with the registers it was waiting on.

---

## The second project for a client

Nothing carries over. Every register is empty per project: a talent from the last job is not on
this one until a person enters them again. What does carry over is the client folder: the
sites, the templates and the skills, so the second project asks four questions and nothing else.
