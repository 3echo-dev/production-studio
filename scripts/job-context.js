// Six scripts already work this out for themselves in slightly different ways: `heartbeat.js`
// and `turn.js` find the open job, `export-events.js` reads the credit tally out of
// `status.md`, `turn.js` decides which of the ten stages a state belongs to. A function hook
// cannot require any of that, because it runs in the engine's worker rather than in node, so
// it asks for the answer through `$.process.run`. That is what this exists to answer.
//
// It resolves nothing itself. Every fact below comes from the library that owns it:
// `lib-workspace.js` for the root, `lib-open-job.js` for which job is open, `lib-states.js`
// for whether the state is a gate, `lib-wording.js` for the sentence a person reads, and
// `hooks/turn.js` for the `**Name:** value` reader and the stage lookup it already had to
// write. A second copy of any of those is a second answer waiting to disagree.
//
// It never touches the network, so it costs the same in a folder that is not the pipeline's,
// and it always exits 0 with a whole answer: a hook that has to tell an exit code
// apart from a crash is a hook that fails closed on a folder with no jobs in it yet.
