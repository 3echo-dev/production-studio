# Release: {title}

Client: {client} · Project: {job-id} · Released: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM {tz} by {release approver}

Gate C: Release to shoot. Every file here is bound to the approval that released it; `manifest.json` carries the hashes. A file that changes after this point is a new version and Gate C is asked again for that day.

## What is in this folder

| File | What it is | Approved by | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `breakdown.xlsx` | The concept breakdown in the client's template | | |
| `call-sheets/day-1.xlsx` | Call sheet, shoot day 1 | | |
| `manifest.json` | sha256 of every file above, and the approval ids | | |

## Shoot days

| Day | Date | Call time | Units | Location | Sheet |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Not released

Day sheets the production lead did not approve are not here. They stay in the job folder until they are.

## Where the rest is

Script, storyboard, shot list, audio requirements and registers live in the job folder and are not part of the release package. The timeline carries the issued shoot days.
